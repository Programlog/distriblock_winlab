# DistriBlock: Identifying adversarial audio samples by leveraging characteristics of the output distribution
We propose DistriBlock, a novel detection method for adversarial attacks on neural network-based state-of-the-art ASR systems. We show that characteristics of the distribution over the output tokens can serve as features of binary classifiers.
